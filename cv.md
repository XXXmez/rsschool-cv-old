But I did not finish my studies because I did not have enough time to write my thesis. At the moment I am finishing my studies in the city of Tula at a private vocational education institution *SOCIAL-TECHNOLOGICAL COLLEGE* with a degree in Applied Informatics.

### About me
He graduated from high school in 2014. I went to study for secondary specialized education. Did not finish his studies in 2018, went to the army. After the army, he worked and did not finish his studies as he thought how to do it and not sit at a desk. In 2021, he began to continue his studies in the standard form. Since 2020, I have been working in an organization dealing with spare parts and other accessories for agricultural and auto equipment.
I'm too lazy and different life situations can specifically distract me from my goals, that's why I'm still learning!

### My skills and interests
I can say the following about myself, I have: self-organization, punctuality, the ability to work in a team, ambitious, kind, polite.

P.S. Do not judge rudely for the photo, I just have very few photos
